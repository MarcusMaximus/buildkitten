![](logo.png)

A small menubar app that shows your BuildKite Builds. Supports MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

Download the current version: [v0.1.0](https://github.com/jamesmacfie/buildkite/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

You can still navigate around the Buildkite site from this window but there are some CSS changes which may screw things up for you.
